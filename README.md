# Activity Overview
conduct a vulnerability assessment for a small business. A vulnerability assessment is the internal review process of an organization’s security systems. You will evaluate the risks of a vulnerable information system and outline a remediation plan. This is an activity in the [Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/cybersecurity-certificate).

# Scenario
You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

You are tasked with completing a vulnerability assessment of the situation to communicate the potential risks to decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.

# Vulnerability Assessment Report

## System Description
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

## Scope
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

## Purpose
The purpose of this vulnerability assessment is to identify potential risks associated with the server used by the company. The server is an essential asset to the company as it is the backbone of the company. Critical information is stored on the remote database that the employees of the company use on a regular basis. The server has been open to the public since the company’s launch and is a severe risk to the company. If the server was tampered with and was disabled, the company would endure loss of revenue, potential data loss, and a disruption to their business operations.

## Risk Assessment

| Threat Source | Threat Event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Hacker | Installing malicious software on the server and gaining access to sensitive information | 3 | 3 | 9 |
| Employee | Compromise the integrity of information that would disrupt critical business operations | 2 | 3 | 6 |
| Customer | Altering/Deleting critical data from the server | 1 | 3 | 3 |

## Approach
In conducting the qualitative vulnerability assessment, I've selected threat sources and events based on their potential impact on the company's business operations and critical assets. The threats posed by hackers installing malicious software, employees compromising data integrity, and customers altering or deleting critical data represent significant risks due to their potential to disrupt business continuity, cause financial loss, and damage the company's reputation. These scenarios are plausible and have moderate to high likelihood, making them imperative to address promptly to safeguard the company's assets and ensure uninterrupted operations.

## Remediation Strategy
To address the identified risks, several security controls can be implemented. Firstly, implementing the principle of least privilege ensures that users have only the necessary access rights to perform their tasks, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access by employees. Secondly, employing a defense-in-depth strategy involves layering security mechanisms throughout the system, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software, to mitigate the risk of hackers installing malicious software on the server. Lastly, enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing the server can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access by enhancing authentication security, especially against external threats like hackers.
